QUICK SETUP - Using Military Demo Scene
================================================================================

Super simple setup using the existing demo scene!

================================================================================
STEP 1: OPEN THE DEMO SCENE
================================================================================

1. In Unity, open Project window (bottom)
2. Navigate to: Assets > Synty > PolygonMilitary > Scenes
3. Double-click "Demo.unity"
4. The scene will load with a complete military base environment

================================================================================
STEP 2: CREATE THE PLAYER PREFAB
================================================================================

1. In Project window, navigate to:
   Assets > Synty > PolygonMilitary > Prefabs > Characters

2. Find "SM_Chr_Soldier_Male_01" (or any soldier you like)
   - Drag it into the Hierarchy (left side)

3. Rename it to "Player":
   - Click on it in Hierarchy
   - Press F2 (or right-click > Rename)
   - Type "Player"

4. ADD COMPONENTS (all in Inspector on the right):

   Click "Add Component" button, then add each of these:

   a) Character Controller
      - After adding, set these values:
      - Center Y: 1
      - Height: 2
      - Radius: 0.5

   b) Network Object
      - Just add it, no settings needed

   c) Network Transform
      - Just add it, no settings needed

   d) FPS Controller (our script)
      - Just add it for now

5. CREATE CAMERA:

   a) Right-click "Player" in Hierarchy
      - Select: Create Empty
      - Name it: "PlayerCamera"

   b) Select PlayerCamera:
      - Add Component > Camera
      - Add Component > Audio Listener
      - In Transform section:
        - Position X: 0
        - Position Y: 1.6 (eye height)
        - Position Z: 0

   c) Link the camera:
      - Select "Player" in Hierarchy
      - In FPS Controller component (in Inspector)
      - Find "Camera Transform" field
      - Drag "PlayerCamera" from Hierarchy into that field

6. MAKE IT A PREFAB:

   - Drag "Player" from Hierarchy down to Project window (Assets folder)
   - This creates Player.prefab
   - DELETE "Player" from Hierarchy (we'll spawn it via network)

================================================================================
STEP 3: ADD ANIMATOR (Important!)
================================================================================

1. Select your Player.prefab in Assets folder

2. In Hierarchy, expand the prefab (click the arrow)
   - You'll see child objects with the mesh

3. Find the object with "Animator" component
   - Usually the main mesh object

4. In Inspector, find "Animator" component:
   - Controller field: Drag in "AC_Polygon_Masculine" controller
   - Find it at: Assets > Synty > AnimationBaseLocomotion > Animator

   If you can't find it, that's okay - we'll fix it later

================================================================================
STEP 4: ADD NETWORK MANAGER TO SCENE
================================================================================

1. In Hierarchy, right-click empty space
   - Create Empty
   - Name it: "NetworkManager"

2. With NetworkManager selected, Add Component:
   - Type: "Network Manager"
   - Click to add it

3. Configure NetworkManager:

   a) Find "NetworkManager" component in Inspector

   b) Under "NetworkPrefabs":
      - Click the "+" button
      - Drag your Player.prefab into the new slot

   c) Find "Player Prefab" field:
      - Drag Player.prefab into this field

4. ADD THE MENU:
   - With NetworkManager still selected
   - Add Component > "Simple Network Menu"

================================================================================
STEP 5: FIX THE MAIN CAMERA
================================================================================

The demo scene has a Main Camera that will conflict with player cameras.

1. In Hierarchy, find "Main Camera"
2. DELETE IT (right-click > Delete)

We don't need it because each player spawns with their own camera.

================================================================================
STEP 6: SAVE AND TEST!
================================================================================

1. SAVE THE SCENE:
   - File > Save (or Ctrl+S)

2. PRESS PLAY:
   - Click the Play button (top center)
   - You should see "HOST GAME" and "JOIN GAME" buttons

3. CLICK "HOST GAME"
   - You should spawn into the military base
   - Try moving: WASD keys
   - Try looking: Move mouse
   - Try jumping: Space bar
   - Try sprinting: Hold Shift while moving

4. UNLOCK CURSOR (if you want to click Disconnect):
   - Press Escape
   - Cursor will appear
   - Click "DISCONNECT" button

================================================================================
STEP 7: TEST MULTIPLAYER
================================================================================

1. BUILD THE GAME:
   - File > Build Settings
   - Click "Add Open Scenes"
   - Click "Build"
   - Save it somewhere (like Desktop/KlyraFPS.exe)

2. RUN THE EXE FILE:
   - Navigate to where you saved it
   - Double-click KlyraFPS.exe
   - Click "HOST GAME"

3. IN UNITY EDITOR:
   - Click Play button
   - Click "JOIN GAME"
   - You should now see TWO players in the military base!

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

PROBLEM: "Character stuck in T-pose or falling animation"
SOLUTION:
- Select Player.prefab
- Make sure Animator component has AC_Polygon_Masculine controller
- Make sure animator parameters are: MoveSpeed, IsGrounded, IsJumping

PROBLEM: "Can't move when I spawn"
SOLUTION:
- Make sure CharacterController is on Player prefab
- Check that FPSController script is attached

PROBLEM: "No HOST GAME button appears"
SOLUTION:
- Make sure NetworkManager GameObject exists in scene
- Make sure SimpleNetworkMenu script is attached to NetworkManager

PROBLEM: "Player falls through floor"
SOLUTION:
- The demo scene should have colliders already
- If falling, check that the environment objects have colliders

PROBLEM: "Can't see anything when I spawn"
SOLUTION:
- Make sure PlayerCamera is positioned at Y=1.6
- Make sure PlayerCamera has Camera component
- Make sure you deleted the old Main Camera from scene

PROBLEM: "Two players spawn in same spot"
SOLUTION:
- This is normal! They spawn at (0, 0, 0)
- Just walk away from each other
- Later we can add spawn points

================================================================================
CONTROLS
================================================================================

W - Forward
S - Backward
A - Left
D - Right
Mouse - Look around
Space - Jump
Left Shift (hold) - Sprint
Escape - Unlock cursor

================================================================================

That's it! You now have a working multiplayer FPS in the military demo scene!

The scripts handle all the networking automatically:
- FPSController.cs = Movement, jumping, mouse look, animation sync
- SimpleNetworkMenu.cs = Host/Join buttons

Next steps could be:
- Add weapons
- Add health system
- Add multiple spawn points
- Deploy to WebGL
- Connect to Render.com server
