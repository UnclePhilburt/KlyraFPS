================================================================================
WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK?
================================================================================

Common Issues:

1. "I don't see HOST GAME button"
   - Make sure NetworkManager exists in Hierarchy
   - Make sure SimpleNetworkMenu component is on NetworkManager
   - Check Console for errors (red text)

2. "I see button but nothing happens when I click"
   - Check Console for errors
   - Make sure Player prefab is in NetworkManager's Player Prefab field
   - Make sure Player prefab is in NetworkPrefabs list

3. "I spawn but can't move"
   - Make sure CharacterController is on Player prefab
   - Make sure FPSController script is on Player prefab

4. "I spawn but fall through the floor"
   - Make sure you're using Demo scene
   - The scene should have ground with colliders

5. "Character is stuck in falling animation"
   - This means animator isn't set up
   - Go back to PART 5 and assign the animator controller

6. "I can't see anything when I spawn"
   - Make sure PlayerCamera exists under Player prefab
   - Make sure Camera Transform is linked in FPSController
   - Make sure you deleted the old Main Camera

7. "Second player doesn't spawn"
   - Make sure Player prefab is in NetworkPrefabs list
   - Check both Console windows for errors
   - Make sure both are on same network (same computer works)
